These files were created in anaconda-navigator 2.7,jupyter notebooks (in a machine learning environment with some additional tensorflow/keras packages), I have not included the full data files required to run the, as some of these materials I do not own. However the files you see here clearly show my problem solving and coding solutions in Machine/Deep Learning.
